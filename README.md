## üí° Notes

* **First-time Model Loading:** The first time you select a language, the corresponding model will be downloaded. This might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection. Subsequent uses of the same language will be faster as the model will be cached.
* **Audio Quality:** For best results, ensure your audio recordings are clear with minimal background noise.
* **Long Audio Handling:** Audio files longer than approximately 25 seconds will be automatically processed in smaller chunks to prevent memory issues and improve performance.
